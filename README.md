# Kaggle Competition: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Introduction
In this project, I aim to explore and implement machine learning techniques to solve the Titanic survival prediction problem. This repository serves as a resource for understanding and implementing the basics of machine learning for binary classification tasks.

## About the Project
This repository is an ongoing project, where I continually update it with new implementations and optimized solutions for the Titanic survival prediction problem. My goal is to implement the most effective methods and techniques to make this repository a valuable resource for learning.

## Problem Understanding
- The goal of the Titanic project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and ticket fare. 
- It's a binary classification problem where the target variable is "Survived" (1 if survived, 0 if not survived).

## Techniques:
Applied binary classification method, feature engineering, logistic regression, random forest classifier to build predictive models.

## Impact:
Demonstrated the ability to tackle a classic machine learning problem, showcasing proficiency in building and validating predictive models using real-world data.
